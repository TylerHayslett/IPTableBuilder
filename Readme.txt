This is a handy tool. 

Cisco Devices have no table for interface to IP connections.

I built this utility to telnet into a Cisco Device at a given IP 
and pull down its connection list.

You provide the login information to the device. The return is of the format:
Device port - IP Address of opposite device - Port on opposite device.

Hope you like it!

(I will be fleshing it out with comments whenever I have time, but everything's named right and its neat)
